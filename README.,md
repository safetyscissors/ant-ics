# Ant-ICS
A school project on swarm behavior. Individuals randomly explore but leave information to influence future individuals. Try it at [theninthbit](http://theninthbit.us/ics/ant.htm)

## Purpose
 - class project for an insect course. 
 - exploring applications of structuring random bruteforcing

## This is
 - a simulation of ants randomly walking and leaving pheromones that strengthen as they find their target.
 - js canvas screen with an animation loop

## Todo
 - pheromone trail behavior needs updating. Ants return to the nest with a different pheromone  trail. 
 - These trail signals weaken over time.
 - The ants are influenced by the number of trails they cross over to understand the general flow of traffic. 

## I learned
 - random behavior is not truly random. The hardest part of ant movement was the balance between unpredictable and our expectation of their behavior. After several iterations, the final random walk algorithm is a max 15degrees per step with a parabolic weighting, being most inclined to walk forward. 
 - My newest project with insect movement uses fairly random waypoints based on stimuli instead of setting random movement per step. The waypoint method allows for easier animation.
